# CPP-DIP: Multi-objective Coverage Path Planning for MAVs in Dispersed and Irregular Plantations

## Overview
CPP-DIP is a multi-objective coverage path planning framework designed for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) to efficiently navigate dispersed and irregular plantations. It leverages image-based tree detection, density-aware waypoint generation, target-based path planning, and object-based path optimization to minimize flight distance, turning angles, intersection paths, and redundant coverage.

Our paper is available on arXive now [[PDF]]().

This repository contains codes of algrithoms used in this paper.

The code will be uploaded soon.
