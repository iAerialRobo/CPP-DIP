# CPP-DIP: Multi-objective Coverage Path Planning for MAVs in Dispersed and Irregular Plantations

## Overview
<p align="justify">
CPP-DIP is a multi-objective coverage path planning framework designed for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) to efficiently navigate dispersed and irregular plantations. It leverages image-based tree detection, density-aware waypoint generation, target-based path planning, and object-based path optimization to minimize flight distance, turning angles, intersection paths, and redundant coverage.
